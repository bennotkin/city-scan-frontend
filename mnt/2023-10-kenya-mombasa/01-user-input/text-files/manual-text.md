### Basic City Information

**Gagarin** is a village in the Sevan Municipality of the Gegharkunik region of Armenia. It was founded in 1955, and proudly bears the name of Yuri Gagarin, the first human to orbit the Earth. Gagarin is located near Lake Sevan, the largest lake in the Caucasus, and only 50 km from the capital Yerevan. Surrounded by mountains, roughly 11,000 inhabitants live in several villages spread throughout the district of Sevan.

The local economy of the district thrives primarily on tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. The fertile lands surrounding Lake Sevan support various agricultural activities, and fishing in the lake itself is a significant economic contributor. The lake yields various fish species that are harvested and sold locally and regionally.

Armenia has set a target of attracting 2.5 million tourists annually by 2026. In pursuit of this objective, the DAR Foundation for Regional Development and Competitiveness has established the Gagarin Project. This initiative focuses on the development of Gagarin, as well as Geghamavan, Ddmashen, Zovaber, Tsaghkunk, and Varser settlements within the Sevan community. The overarching goal of the Gagarin Project is to foster sustainable development within a self-sufficient community, with a particular emphasis on creating a competitive education ecosystem, establishing a high-quality environment, and promoting sustainable economic growth, notably in the realm of agriculture.
